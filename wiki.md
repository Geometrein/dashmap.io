# ðŸŽŠ Welcome to the Dashmap wiki!
### Overview
##### What is Dashmap?
DashMap is an open source web platform that gathers, analyses and visualises urban data.

##### What is Dashmap made of?
DashMap is an isolated Plot.ly.Dash app wrapped in a parent Flask app. This allows utilizing the highly customizable Flask app to serve the Plotly dashboards without paying a hefty fee for Dash Enterprise license. You get the best of both worlds. The ease of creating dashboards with Plotly and the rich features of Flask. Of course, there are tradeoffs but for the current scale of the application, these are insignificant.
##### Pros:
- Flask and Dash apps can be modified, styled and developd separately!
- Quick dashboards with Plotly/dash
- All Flask features (Flask-Login, Flask-Admin, Flask-Assets).
##### Cons:
- Performance
- Python infused front end is not ideal.

### Installation

#### **With Docker Compose**
Navigate to projects root directory and run:
```
docker-compose up
```
### You're all set ðŸš€

---

If you like making things more difficult be my guest and go ahead with these methods:
#### **With Docker**
Navigate to projects parent directory and run:
```
docker build --no-cache dashmap.io -t dashmap
docker run -p  80:80  dashmap
```
Done!

And if you just want to have more commands to blaze away in the terminal, then I have this for you:
#### **Old School Way**
Set up a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv venv
```


Activate the virtual environment:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install requirements.txt
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Done!
