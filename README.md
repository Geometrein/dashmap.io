![Demo](website/static/images/notebook.gif) 

# **About**
DashMap is an open source web platform that gathers, analyses and visualizes urban data. It is free and can be used by everyone for anything. Some popular use cases include decision making, data journalism, relocation, urban planning, marketing, and real estate.

### **Mission**
**Open data should benefit everyone regardless of their background!** However, open data is often provided in JSON format and accessed through convoluted API requests. This is great for machines but looking at this data will make your eyes bleed. DashMap handles the data for you allowing you to focus on the insights!

# **Technical Overview**
### **What's its DashMap made of?**
 DashMap is an isolated Plot.ly.Dash app wrapped in a parent Flask app. This allows to utilize the highly customizable Flask app to serve the Plotly dashboards without paying a hefty fee for Dash Enterprise license. You basically get the best of both worlds. The ease of creating dashboards with Plotly and the rich features of Flask(Flask-Login, Flask-Admin, Flask-Assets). This structure also allows to modify, style and develop the apps separately!

### **Data Sources**
DashMap utilizes data from a vast variety of datasets available in Helsinki open data ecosystem.
Main data sources used are:
